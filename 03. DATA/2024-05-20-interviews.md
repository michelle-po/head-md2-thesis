# Qualitative Interviews

## Goal description

With this interview, I aim to find some insights that won't come off working individually on my desktop. I want to explore the difference in the digital relationship between digital natives and digital immigrants. The only problem will be to ask the rights questions. Some (old) people will not have a real consumption of a computer, so I need to ask for a POV and an opinion that could allow them to answer.

## Sampling

WHO: DI and DN, different jobs and degrees
WHEN: 20 may-31 may
WHERE: Vaud/Ticino/Italy

## Questions

1.  Are you a computer owner? / There is a computer in your house?

3.  Was it your initiative in your private life or due to a need at your school/work? Were you helped by someone/lessons?
4.  Was it hard to understand how it works?
5.  Do you think it helped in your daily tasks?
6.  There is a physical action in your life that it's now totally replaced with a digital option?
7.  What is your daily consumption of computers now? (Is it part of your life? What do you use it for? You ask someone to do it for you?)
8.  Do you have a special relationship/story with your actual device? How did you choose/buy it?
9.  What's for you the problem with your computer? Are you able to troubleshoot?
10. How do you feel about new technologies?
11. Choice of next device (are there any expectations on the machine?)

## Answers

### Person 1 (DI, 1960, music teacher)

1. fix hackintosh computer (mac built) with instrumentation for music production, laptop for music recording.
2. before 2000, probably 93-94, he did the school's courses with a friend, didn't understand anything but he had a desire to learn so had a positive approach despite the difficulty.
3. the school offered the introductory course, he played in advance as he saw the probable trend and improtance that technology would have in the future. He wanted to get ahead of the times and not get caught up in the water with computer use in general.
4. The biggest difficulty was the difference between files, folders. He did not understand file management in general. Managing preferences was also complicated. At school they started with a mac SE.
5. He organised his working environment, organised the musical bases for the children, documents, organisation, mail, news, media consumption in general. Out of passion he started to do sound technician work.
6. Reading the news in newspapers, informing himself with the radio or through online portals, writing and sending letters. Write, record and play music.
7. normally watch the news, emails, shopping,... on average 1 hour. if he has a delivery due to his job depends, he can also spend the whole day using music manipulation software.
8. simplicity and reliability, he had to have a mac from apple but didn't want to spend the money to get the most advanced version of the hardware. He therefore decided to hire a computer scientist from Turin to create a hackintosh, i.e. custom hardware but with an apple operating system. He was thus able to bring together the hardware he wanted and the software he had always used. He had to hire an external person because it is extremely difficult to make this kind of machine.
9. Apart from when the hackintosh gives problems and so he doesn't dare too much to change the settings the technician had made, he manages to replace components, reinstall the OS, programmes, accounts, passwords, he had removed the cd dvd drive from the laptop and added the chassis to put the SSD disk. If he could, he preferred to do it himself. at first he relied a lot on people he knew who knew more than you, then slowly he understood how it worked. At home he installed the wifi network, the server, the cameras, replaced components, soldered cables,...
10. technology is replacing the human side, we ask too much from machines, there is no longer a human factor. "Chat I don't know what" that will replace humans as well? it's fine to innovate, research, innovate, progress... but it's going too far and we're losing common sense. things are invented to improve people's lives. it depends on who these technologies are used by, if it's for good, ok, but the world is not so honest. dishonest people use them for their own interests.
    At almost 60 years old, he was born in a time when these things didn't exist and he took what suited him. My daughter was born with technology in her hands.
    "We instead adapted, we took the best of what was there out of necessity, but we had no choice.
    Facebook has perhaps done more harm than good, maybe it was better that it wasn't there. Everyone wants to be important. He doesn't agree with social media, he believes it's a tool for general life hypocrisy. "10,000 followers and you're alone drinking at the bar."
    He doesn't think he can keep up with the new technologies as he gets older. "when you work you need them, in retirement there are more important things in life". he thinks he can still manage social (QR code payments for example), but will probably remain behinf for more. Already now with airline bookings he does not feel comfortable, because he has never done he is afraid of making mistakes and of online fraud.
11. given the power of laptops, he would take one and attach it to a monitor for the fixed location, so he would still have the flexibility of a laptop. Price.
    "But we don't know how computers will be developed in the future. if you have to work on the computer OK, but for lighter consumption an ipad is more than enough. Many times you don't even need a real computer, most people wouldn't need one."
    He manages to keep up to date as far as possible on the IT level, but he is still surprised that younger people do not manage to do the same, sometimes finding their level lacking. 25-30 year old colleagues use computers on a superficial level, they do not have the curiosity to look further afield.
    He believes in optimising time and resources. "Jobs are

### Person 2 (DN, 1998, student on sabbatical year):

1.  She has her laptop (2019) and another in the family that was his old (older) one.
2.  Very first approach was in primary school at around 9 years old, with an Apple (OSX). Having never had technology at home, it was exciting.
3.  at school, 1 hour a week writing with word, excel table, course given by a teacher. This initiation helped her but little, when she got to middle school she saw the big picture. in middle school more developed texts, powerpoint, typing, then as she grew up it became necessary for little 3d graphic models.
4.  the first approach was very intuitive and simple for the needs she had at that time.
5.  it depends on the life you live, at the moment it fills the gaps in her day. In general it is used as media reproduction, the rest she prefers to do by hand.
6.  Not many digital replacements. She prefers handwriting, memos, sketches and drawings always on the physical side. On the phone instead reminders, calculator, alarm clock, torch,...
7.  2h a day for a movie, on average.
8.  when she had to go to university she looked for a light, touchscreen computer. The choice is not so much technical but quality-price. Opened it that already had a burnt pixel but she never had it repaired. Not too special a relationship. The first one was a gift from the family for high school. replaced the old one for the next one.
9.  never had any major problems, only minor problems, realises she is ignorant of problems and asks her boyfriend for help. She tries to look for it, but not knowing where to look she prefers not to do it herself. e.g. deactivating the touchscreen she didn't know how to do, she asked her boyfriend and they solved it. the feeling of insecurity at having to go and find a setting or go beyond the usual. More than surfing the internet and writing texts/emails the computer is not used.
10. boomer, far behind her peers, thinks she has a personal closure towards technology, has settled into the minimum required by the school and has not had the curiosity to go further. She feels disadvantaged in some cases, she would like to be able to solve problems. The world is based on technology, so in addition to the small there will be more societal problems. So staying in the small will lead her to more and more problems. Like the older generations have problems at present. worry about when they start school/work again, not being able to keep up with things or understand them. Not being able to adapt to today's standards.
11. not much, wouldn't have much knowledge to be able to assess properly. probably size and weight would influence. Maybe in black color.

### Person 3 (DN, 1998, Product designer):

1. yes, several at home, 3 computers that belong to him (if you don't count the tablets and phone), 1 old one, 1 desktop computer for gaming with large screens and tools for music and a laptop for lighter tasks to work anywhere. 6 in total with his mother and brother.
2. first approach--> about 7 years old, father's laptop for online games (tetris), very supervised with dad too, started at 12-13 on his own. first computer received in 2013 (14-15 years old), considered "late" for him. windows at first, then developed on mac. dad had windows.
3. father showed him how it worked in general, but didn't get much help, just supervised. no tutorials. problem solving just with his father, otherwise fairly autonomous.
4. yes and no, quickly understood what was needed to play alone. Ongoing discovery! currently no problems with the basics, but sometimes there are processes he could do better and more optimised. "there's always a good way and another way that works but isn't ideal". For example: backup in a folder without too much notteoyage and optimisation and without sorting.
5. cloud, document/media sharing, diary, "if there's something physical it can easily be forgotten". Having lots of information on digital devices means you don't forget things.
6. make notes, appointments, instead of writing on paper. His design work was never done on paper. In general, more for anything organisational, accessibility of information in general.
7. at the weekend, 1h30-2h30 to watch videos or play games. 2h in the afternoon to play games. maybe in the evening to watch videos for 2h. --> mainly media consumption (gaming or videos,...). Other consumption on other devices. 4 h of gaming in general plus others to see.
8. first gaming computer given to me by my dad. the old one was also given to me by my dad, an old computer from the office. First one bought was chosen with dad: it's 10 years old but it works well and it's synonim of the years spent on minecraft at the time. dad brought it to tech.
9. he asks on the internet, maybe his father if really. most of it he can solve by himself.
10. very optimistic, even if we'll have to be careful with derivatives, a bit like abusive trends (nft, crypto,...), "giving a real purpose to a technology that doesn't have one yet". stuff that serves no purpose, only for profit and the beauty of gests. As soon as there are batteries that last longer, less energy will be wasted, helping several individuals with computing power and therefore more sustainable in the long term. we must be aware, we are halfway to optimization. technology is a great way to semplify or suppress unnecessary action in lo daily. he likes the optimization of time / resources.
11. it depends on how you use it, at home for gaming or as a laptop for working on the train. He'll probably be looking at components, power, ram, good quality, benchmarks, reviews, does it work well? are people happy? is it pretty, light, easy to put in the bag? Probably also the OS (windows vs mac vs chrome os). Personal comparison table with all the info.

### Person 4 (DI, 1960, ex-luxury shop saleswoman, now unemployed):

1. "yes there is a laptop at home, an apple Mac, I don't use it much but it is indispensable in my daily life."
2. the first computer was at work, used for receiving emails and answering customers and company communications, as well as opening and closing the till. Managing after-sales, and following up with customers (communications in general).
   In 2003 she started using the computer (43 years). Like all new things even if you know how to do the till and accounts, having to approach a new way of collecting and managing money, sales, and labels, can cause anxiety and stress.
   But when you learn, it's more precise and secure: you understand the advantage of not having all the paperwork. Easier to follow and manage.
   Doing the accounts more accurately with foreign exchange, after a while you understand the advantages it gives you, the ease of following all the cash processes.
   The biggest difficulty was closing the till, you had to enter a lot of data on different files, mail, short time to manage the money, print the documents, where to save them, who to send them to and how. One could not make mistakes.
3. during the digitalization courses at work, she learned step by step, with disemployment (closing the shop), she had courses on how to manage her e-mails, and computer skills: how to write an e-mail, how to answer a job advertisement, how to announce herself to a company. But at the unemployment cantonal office, they assumed she had an e-mail, a computer and knew how to use it.
4. there are gaps she doesn't know exactly what she is doing, but she knows what software or hardware is, and how to turn it on and use it. But she is not interested in understanding more than that. Maybe, she would like to be able to handle problems more independently.
5. unemployment (mail and online platform management), printing.
   The smartphone is more convenient and more accessible. The computer is cumbersome to have it at all times. If it weren't for work she wouldn't use it. Advantages? bigger screen, if there is something to see it is easier and more convenient, more beautiful.
6. mail, bank actions, and filling out forms.
7. rarely, weekly for compulsory job searches.
8. handover from the daughter who bought a new computer.
9. depends on the problem. in case of problems, she calls the daughter. "when it doesn't work my generation would turn it off and on". not able to investigate, try to get out, turn it off and on again.
10. if at first she hated it because it stressed her out, thinking that she had to use it or lag behind her colleagues, now she is quite able to manage (despite being part of the older generation and having had to adapt in order to keep up in the working and private world). when she has managed to understand how to make it work, to get to the level of easily understanding everyday life, the computer has become indispensable and also pleasant because it gives access to the news. it is an interesting new way of communicating, of knowing, a new way of accessing everything that used to be written down somewhere and therefore less accessible.
    "This, however, leads to being more alone, more isolated, and not needing to socialize which is not good for a human being, it feels like having everything with a computer in front of you. even though it's not like that. Seeing a cat on a screen is nice, but it can't match the cooties of a real animal keeping you company."
11. I will ask my daughter first, but I Would love to see on a big screen and it should be an apple, because now I'm more confident with them.

## Analysis

In this two exemples of both DI and DN, we can see that we can still have somebody who have more expertise in technology than the other interviewee in the same category. In all four cases they said they are afraid of be left behid by the advancement of technology. In person 1 and 3
are resigned to not understanding how certain things work, while others still hope to have the basic knowledge to be able to follow future social digitisation.
But the DI are resigned also cause of their age, they know that "is normal" not understand how certain things work. In he DN there is, instead, a sort of shame compared to peers who understand more.

A concept that has been mentioned several times is optimisation, how technology has optimised processes but at the expense of the human side.
An aura of fear towards new technologies was shared by all participants except number 2, who said that caution should be exercised in all things.
