DX- digital transformation

digital maturity

Digital disruption is an effect that changes the fundamental expectations and behaviors in a culture, market, industry or process that is caused by, or expressed through, digital capabilities, channels or assets.

According to Eurostat, in the EU, 87 percent of people aged 75 years and over have never been online (2018).

the WIMP (windows, icons, menus, pointer) model

The Macintosh was designed to be "the computer for the rest of us" and succeeded well enough that it became, as Alan Kay once said, "the first personal computer good enough to be criticized."

WYSIWYG

The three classic problems with metaphors [9] are:

The target domain has features not in the source domain (e.g., telling the user that "a word processor is like a typewriter" would not lead the user to look for the replace command).
The source domain has features not in the target domain (a typewriter has the ability to mark up any form you receive in the mail, but a user trying to do that on current computer systems will normally fail).
Some features exist in both domains but work very differently (the treatment of white space representing space characters, tabs, and line feeds is very different on typewriters and in word processors). Therefore, users may have trouble seeing beyond the metaphor to use the system in the ways it was intended. It is possible to design interfaces to map very closely to metaphors (e.g., Bob Mack's NOSE-no-surprise editor really did act like a typewriter in all respects), but those interfaces will often be very low-powered and suited mainly for walk-up-and-use situations.

Instead, we need to develop new interface paradigms based on the structure of computer systems and the tasks users really have to perform, rather than paradigms that enshrine outmoded technology.
